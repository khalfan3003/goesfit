        <img src="./media/images-removebg-preview.png" alt="samba shoe">
        <p class="para">The Samba was designed in 1949 to enable football players to train on icy, hard ground (hence the suction design on the gumsole). Its original design featured the classic three stripes, as well as the gold trefoil on the foldable tongue. As years progressed, the trainer evolved into the Samba Millennium (which was made without the extended tongue) and the Samba '85.[3] Vintage versions of the trainer are still in production, under the name Classic M.[4][5][6]


            Black/Almost Yellow Samba OG
            Some sources have said the name was inspired by the Samba being released close to the 1950 soccer World Cup in Brazil and the country's association with samba music and carnival culture.[7][8] However, Adidas has said this was not the case, and that the shoe was given the nickname at German football matches.[9]</p>

            <p class="para"> Rolex SA (/ˈroʊlɛks/) is a Swiss watch brand and manufacturer based in Geneva, Switzerland.[2] Founded in 1905 as Wilsdorf and Davis by German businessman Hans Wilsdorf and his brother-in-law Alfred Davis in London, the company registered Rolex as the brand name of its watches in 1908 and became Rolex Watch Co. Ltd. in 1915.[3][4][5][6] After World War I, the company moved its base of operations to Geneva because of the unfavorable economy in the United Kingdom. In 1920, Hans Wilsdorf registered Montres Rolex SA in Geneva as the new company name (montre is French for watch); it later became Rolex SA.[2][4][7][8] Since 1960, the company has been owned by the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, a private family trust.[5][9][10]</p>

            <p class="para">Cristóbal Balenciaga opened his first boutique in San Sebastián, Spain, in 1919, and expanded to include branches in Madrid and Barcelona.[4] The Spanish royal family and aristocracy wore his designs. When the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his stores, he moved to Paris.[4][5]

                Balenciaga opened his Paris couture house on Avenue George V in August 1937, where his first fashion show featured designs heavily influenced by the Spanish Renaissance.[4] His success was nearly immediate. In two years, the press lauded him as a revolutionary, and his designs were highly sought-after.[4] Carmel Snow, the editor of Harper's Bazaar, was an early champion of his designs.[6]
                
                Historians believe that Balenciaga's continued activity during the Nazi occupation of Paris was made possible by his connections with Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco who was Adolf Hitler's close ally.[7] The relation to Franco was so close that Balenciaga designed clothing for the Franco family.[8] The company was one of only 60 allowed to operate during the occupation, and the ongoing supply of raw materials from Spain, which were in short supply in Paris due to the war, gave Balenciaga a competitive advantage. However, he testified that he refused Hitler's request to transfer his company's activities to Berlin.[9][10] </p>
